These tab files represent the following changes from historic pumping:
 
CalAm will only pump 3376 AF annually from the river and will only pump 1 MGD in the summer months.  The rest will be pumped in the winter.
Full Carmel River ASR and Title 13 water rights will be pumped in the winter at 29 AFD and 3.26 AFD respectively.
Non-CalAm pumping was held at the 2010 to 2015 levels
Santa Lucia preserve pumping was held at the 2014 – 2015 levels.
Galante Vineyards diversion was set to the historic record due to water year type influence on the amount they can physically divert.  We may want to see how we could handle this differently, but for now, let’s press on.
San Clemente historic diversions were removed.
Los Padres releases were removed and will be simulated in the Lake Package as the release schedule Thomas developed.
